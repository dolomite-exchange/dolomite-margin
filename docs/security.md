## Independent Audits

### DolomiteMargin

The DolomiteMargin smart contracts were audited independently at various points in their lifecycle by
[Zeppelin Solutions](https://zeppelin.solutions/), Bramah Systems, and most-recently by [SECBIT Labs](https://secbit.io).

The SECBIT audit report covers the most recent suite of updates to the smart contracts. The Zeppelin Solutions and 
Bramah Systems audit reports cover the original version of the smart contracts that was created by dYdX.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

The disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security of our users.

**How to report a security vulnerability?**

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our contracts or platforms,
send it to us by emailing [security@dolomite.io](mailto:security@dolomite.io).
Please include the following details with your report:

* A description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability.

* A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability.

**Scope**

Any vulnerability not previously disclosed by us or our independent auditors in their reports.

**Guidelines**

We require that all reporters:

* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience,
disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing.

* Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us.

* Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and
Dolomite until we’ve had 30 days to resolve the issue.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:

* Not pursue or support any legal action related to your findings.

* Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
(including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission).

* Grant a monetary reward based on the [OWASP risk assessment methodology](https://medium.com/dolomite-official).
