   *                                      liquidation is for closing an expired position. Else, 0.

   *                                      owedWei. Used to prevent sandwiching and mem-pool other attacks. Only used if

   *                                      cover the `liquidAccount`'s debt.
   * @param  revertOnFailToSellCollateral True to revert the transaction completely if all collateral from the
   *                                      liquidation cannot repay the owed debt. False to swallow the error and sell
   *                                      whatever is possible. If set to false, the liquidator must have sufficient
   *                                      assets to prevent being liquidated or under-collateralized.
   * @param  options                      Additional options to be passed through to the web3 call.
